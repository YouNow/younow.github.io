In order for YouNow to remain a safe place to meet new people and participate in vibrant discussions, it's important that we establish community standards in an effort to safeguard the wellbeing of our users to the best of our ability. We do our best to keep YouNow safe, but we cannot guarantee it. The following are a list of rules & guidelines, which, if violated, may result in a suspension or permanent ban from YouNow.

Please also be advised that in applicable situations, we reserve the right to report highly suspicious and/or criminal activity to your local authorities.

## 1. NO VIOLENCE AND/OR SELF HARM

Safety is YouNow's top priority and we take threats of violence and self-harm very seriously. We may remove content that breaches these terms and may also report such content to law enforcement, if we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. Similarly, we prohibit threats and any threat or attempt to threaten other persons may result in a permanent ban.
