The following policy describes such collection and usage.

## **1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT**

Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services you requested and with those we believe will optimize and enhance your use of our Site and related services.

This information, as indicated during the connection process may, include your name, your activities, hometown, interests, likes, user location, your photos and videos, website, email, phone number, friends, online presence, social following and other. This registration process is optional for YouNow users who only wish to view videos, but is required for users who would like to broadcast via YouNow or to use the Service's more advance options.&nbsp;
- Communication from You: When you contact us with questions, concerns or for purposes of customer/technical support, we collect the information contained in your message, which may include your name, contact details and any other personal information you provide.&nbsp;

This information includes URLs or domains of referring websites, browser type, operating system, the pages that you access and the date and time of your visit. In general this aggregate information will not identify you personally, but if we do correlate such information to you, we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;

## **2. WHAT WE MIGHT DO WITH THE INFORMATION COLLECTED**

We may use the information provided to us to:

- Contact you from time to time with critical user or service updates or other information important for our services, or for the support of the service you requested. We may contact you to ensure that the information we have in our records is still correct and to add additional information to complete your profile;&nbsp;

## **3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**

Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required to do so by law or when necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Service, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. We may also disclose your personal data to enforce our policies or respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the right of others. In all cases, such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

We may also share your information with:

- A third party performing services on our behalf that has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as excluding threats from potential cyber attacks or trolls or other security purposes, the processing of your credit card payment, if applicable, or the conduct of an online survey, for example), including our partner, Maker Studios, to provide you with benefits as part of our RPM/YouNow benefit program. Maker Studios will keep such information confidential.&nbsp;
- One of our partners, but only if you've requested this in advance. Please note that in such cases, this Privacy Policy will not cover their information practices and we will not be responsible for the privacy practices exercised by any such partners.&nbsp;

## **4. SECURING THE INFORMATION**

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the information collected and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Service reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

Information received via Facebook Connect is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This ensures that your information is secure as it is sent over the Internet to our server. Furthermore, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your information is only made available to such designated staff as necessary to carry out the stated purposes that we have communicated to you.

In addition, we recommend that you do your part in protecting yourself from unauthorized access to your account by ensuring no one else uses your machine when you are logged in, by logging off from the Site when it is not in use and by keeping your password confidential.

A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web Site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a Site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web Site which may correlate other information, including personally identifiable information, with the cookie.

You should be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of our Site may not function properly or permit access.
