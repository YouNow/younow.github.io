## Our Philosophy

YouNow uses a combination of automated systems and manual monitoring to maintain a safe community on YouNow. Guided by our [Community Standards & Site Rules](/policy/en/rules) and [Terms of Service](/policy/en/terms), we continuously review YouNow broadcasts to warn, suspend, or ban any users who violate our policies.

## Safety Tools

_Blocking a User_

You can block any user from posting on your profile or interacting in your broadcasts. Click or tap on the user’s name, click or tap the red flag icon in his or her mini-profile, and select the “block” option.

_Flagging a User_

Help keep YouNow safe! All users should flag content they believe violates YouNow's policies or puts any member of the community at risk.

When you flag a user, the flag goes to live moderators who will review the situation and take action immediately as they see fit. Please only flag content that you deem inappropriate! Repetitive false flagging could result in a short suspension.

_Parents' Guide_

Are you a parent of a user on YouNow? Feel free to visit our [Parents' Guide](/policy/en/parents) to learn important information about YouNow and general social media safety.

## Underage Users

YouNow users must be at least 13 years of age. If you come across users who are younger than 13, please make sure to flag them.

## Sexual Content

Sexually explicit content is not allowed on YouNow. If you come across an image or broadcast that is explicitly sexual or pornographic in nature, please flag the user immediately so a moderator can review the content and handle the situation accordingly.

Broadcasting, sharing, downloading, or encouraging sexually explicit content can be criminal. Note that we report all instances of child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. For more information on reporting to NCMEC, [please click here](http://www.missingkids.com/CyberTipline).

## Broadcasting Safety Tips

It's important to maintain your privacy and security while broadcasting live. Below are a few tips we recommend you keep in mind while using YouNow.

- Don't share personal information. YouNow allows users to connect with people from all corners of the world, but sharing personal information publicly (including but not limited to phone numbers, home addresses, and email addresses) can open unwanted communication. We strongly discourage you from sharing this sensitive information. 
- Don't click unrecognizable links. In the chat, users may share URLs that link to inappropriate or phishing websites. We ask that you flag the users posting such URLs and make sure not to click on them! 
- Remember that YouNow is a public place and behave accordingly.
- Remember that everything you do gets recorded. After you end your broadcast, the recorded video lives on your profile for three days, and your most recent broadcast is visible until you broadcast again. You do, however, have the ability to remove any video from your profile by navigating to the "broadcasts" tab in your web profile or by tapping “view replays” on your app profile and then swiping left on the broadcast you would like to delete.
