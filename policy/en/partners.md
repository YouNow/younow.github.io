As a member of the Partner Program on YouNow, you serve as an example to other YouNowers, who look to you as a success story and a representative of the YouNow service. Our viewers turn to you for ideas on content for their broadcasts and are inspired by your words and deeds. As such, YouNow partnership comes not only with benefits, but also with responsibility – a responsibility to serve as an example to our users, upholding YouNow’s [Rules] (policy/en/rules), [Terms of Service] (policy/en/terms), and the following additional guidelines, laid out especially for you, as a partner.

## No sexually suggestive dancing.
Are you a great dancer? Awesome. Entertain your audience. But please don't do sexually suggestive moves, such as grinding or twerking.

## Under 18 years old? You must be fully clothed at all times.
If you’re a male and younger than 18, please keep your shirt on! Females, please wear appropriate shirts/shorts/pants.

## Sexual or abusive content.
Do not broadcast sexual or abusive content. This is true also while using other apps during your broadcasts (including Parlor, PartyLine, Basechat, Omegle or other apps used for chat),

## Do not send your viewers to disrupt other broadcasts.
Sending your viewers to bully or “invade” other broadcasters creates unnecessary work for our moderators, reflects poorly on you & YouNow, and is disruptive to other broadcasters. Don't do it.

## Handling “drama” appropriately.
If you have an issue with another YouNow user, handle it in an appropriate way. You can block any user, which will prevent them from becoming your fan, participating in your broadcasts, and commenting on your profile. You can also report users by flagging, or using the “Contact Mods” button on the YouNow website.

## Respect the moderation team.
The YouNow moderators work hard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to keep the YouNow service safe & clean for all users, handling literally millions of users each day, hundreds of thousands of broadcasts, and hundreds of partners. If you receive a warning or message from a moderator, respect it.


We appreciate your diligence in reading through these YouNow Partner Guidelines. Partners failing to follow these Guidelines, the YouNow Rules and Terms of Service will be subject to suspension or termination of their partnership status.

*If you have any questions regarding these Guidelines or the YouNow Rules in general, please feel free to contact your partner manager. We value your opinion and are happy to receive your feedback.
