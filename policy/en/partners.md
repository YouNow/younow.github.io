**Last Updated: September 2018**

As a member of the Partner Program on YouNow, you serve as an example to other YouNowers, who look to you as a success story and a representative of the YouNow service. Our viewers turn to you for ideas on content for their broadcasts and are inspired by your words and deeds. As such, YouNow partnership comes not only with benefits, but also with responsibility – a responsibility to serve as an example to our users, upholding Community Guidelines [Rules] (policy/en/rules), Terms of Service [Terms of Service] (policy/en/terms), and the following additional guidelines, laid out especially for you, as a partner.

Please note that to protect the integrity of the community, as the provider of the service, YouNow reserves the right to suspend or remove any account at any time for any conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or harmful. Continued violations of these rules & guidelines may result in permanent removal of your account and your partnership. 

## Respect the moderation team & company staff.

The YouNow moderators work hard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to keep YouNow safe & clean for all users. The moderation team handles millions of users, hundreds of thousands of broadcasts, and hundreds of partners each day. If you receive a warning or message from a moderator, please respect it. If you believe a moderator has made a mistake or behaved inappropriately, please contact us at support@younow.com for any feedback about other company policies, as well as safety issues or concerns.

Users must also respect YouNow staff & employees. We may take action against users for hateful conduct or harassment that is directed at YouNow staff & employees which may occur both on or off YouNow services. 

## Bullying, harassment, or hate speech is not permitted

Though we encourage YouNow users to express themselves freely within the community guidelines, upholding respect for all community members is paramount. Users who taunt, bully, use hate speech, or engage in any other form of harassment risk being suspended or permanently banned. Remember the Golden Rule, and always be kind! YouNow will review any reported content or activity based on its intent and context. 

**Vulgar language** used on broadcast and in chat is against the rules. **Cursing out other users isn’t just unprofessional, it is abusive.** 

YouNow defines bullying as any behavior that is intended to be hostile, aggressive, abusive, coercive or threatening to hurt another individual physically, mentally or emotionally.

Examples may include:
-	Abusive or offensive language towards others, especially when used with the intention to intimidate or harass;
-	Offensive and repeated name calling with the intent to embarrass or harm someone;
-	Telling someone to hurt or kill themselves, with the intent to encourage self-harm;
-	Creating user accounts dedicated to harassment or hate;
-	Disclosing someone’s personal information against their will with the intent to harm or embarrass them;
-	Encouraging harassment of others.

YouNow prohibits using the platform to facilitate hateful conduct or harassment. We may take action against users for hateful conduct or harassment that occurs off YouNow services that is directed at YouNow users.

## No sexually explicit content, nudity or abusive behavior.

**Sexual dancing is not OK.** Are you a great dancer? Awesome. Entertain your audience. But please avoid sexually suggestive moves, such as grinding, twerking, or mimicking sex. If you aren’t sure, err on the side of caution.

**Do not broadcast sexual content or nudity.** This includes content displayed in other apps during your broadcasts (including Parlor, PartyLine, Basechat, Omegle or other apps used for chat). Remember that you are a community leader and example to others. Encouragement of nudity or sexual conduct is prohibited on YouNow.

Users are not allowed to:
- Use vulgar, profane, or sexually explicit language on camera or in the chat.
- Display offensive or sexually explicit images on camera.
- Perform sexual or sexually suggestive acts, show sex toys onscreen, or dance in a sexually suggestive manner.

Reported content will be reviewed based on context, commentary, attire, environment, camera angle and focus as well as other information including but not limited to broadcast titles, custom thumbnails, and profile descriptions.

**Stricter rules for those under 18.** Users of all genders under the age of 18 must be fully clothed on camera. Any user under the age of 18 without a shirt may be subject to a suspension or permanent ban. This means no underwear, lingerie, or revealing tops/shorts. Users of all ages may not expose genitalia in any way.

## Don’t ask your viewers to break the rules or harass other users.

Your fans look up to you and trust you. Don’t violate that trust by asking for their personal information or photos, or including them in commercial ventures (including sweepstakes!) without their consent.

Sending your viewers to “invade” other broadcasters is bullying and against the Terms of Service [Terms of Service] (policy/en/terms). It creates unnecessary work for our moderators, reflects poorly on you & YouNow, and is disruptive to other broadcasters. Don't do it. If you want to promote the other broadcaster in an appropriate way, guest with them and encourage your audience to fan them.

Encouraging your viewers to harass, spam, or report another user is completely unacceptable. It’s unfair to them and constitutes harassment on your part, for which consequences may include suspension or banning. Be a responsible community leader and encourage your viewers to be positive.

## Violent behavior and/or self-harm is not permitted.

Safety is YouNow's top priority, and we take threats of violence and self-harm very seriously. We may ban users whose content breaches these terms and may also report it to law enforcement if we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. 

Violent behavior includes but is not limited to:

-	threats to physically harm or kill others
-	threats to hack, DDOS, or SWAT others
-	threats or attempts to self-harm 

YouNow strictly prohibits threats and threats to self harm. We encourage any user considering self-harm to seek help. The 24-hour National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255. Please visit YouNow’s Trust Page [here](/policy/en/terms) for other international emergency hot lines.

## Handle drama maturely.

If you have an issue with another YouNow user, handle it in an appropriate way, both on- and off-broadcast. You can block any user, which will prevent them from becoming your fan, participating in your broadcasts, and commenting on your profile. You can also report users by flagging them, if they are violating the Terms of Service. Please note that false or misleading reports of these violations are also strictly against the rules.

## Revealing private contact information is not permitted.

Revealing an individual's personal information, including email addresses, real names, location, ID, phone numbers, home addresses, and others, is forbidden. We also **strongly** recommend that you keep your personal information private.

## Spam & unauthorized advertisement of other live streaming services are not permitted.

We are constantly working to keep YouNow free of spam, scams, and other deceptive practices that attempt to take advantage of the YouNow community. It is forbidden to interrupt the flow of chat sessions with the use of repetitive typing or activity that makes it difficult for users to maintain a conversation, as is the posting of links to pornographic or malicious sites.

It’s not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted, or repetitive content in videos, comments, private messages, profiles or other places on the site. If the main purpose of your content is to drive people off of YouNow and onto another live streaming services via unauthorized advertisements, it will likely violate our spam policies and might lead to a suspension or a permanent ban of your account. This is up to the full discretion of YouNow.

## Prank calls to emergency authorities or hotlines is not permitted

YouNow does not permit prank calls to emergency authorities or emergency hotlines, and any user who in engages in such will be subject to a permanent ban.

## No copyright infringement

YouNow is committed to protecting the rights of copyright holders and seeks to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of intellectual property. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public display, or public performance of copyrighted works is a copyright infringement, and YouNow will undertake appropriate steps against repeat copyright offenders. Re-broadcasting other users’ content without written permission is considered copyright infringement and is therefore prohibited.

On screen legal drug consumption, drug paraphernalia, smoking, and the consumption of alcohol by users under the age of 21 are prohibited.
