**Last updated: May 28, 2020**

YouNow (\"Company\", \"we\" or \"our\") is committed to safeguarding any
personal data that may be collected through our website (the
\"Website\") and mobile application (the \"App\") and together, the
\"Services\". We want you to understand how your personal data will be
used and shared. The following policy describes our personal data
handling practices.

**WHO WE ARE AND GETTING IN TOUCH**

YouNow Media LLC.\'s head office is located in New York, NY, USA. Any
questions or inquiries relating to privacy or data protection should be
directed to our Data Protection Officer
at [privacy\@younow.com](mailto:privacy@younow.com). EU
and California residents may also exercise their data subject rights
such as the right of access or erasure by contacting our Data Protection
Officer.

**PRIVACY COMPLIANCE**

The personal data we collect may be transferred to, stored at and
processed by us and our affiliated third parties outside of the country
in which you reside, where data protection and privacy regulations may
not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world.
However, YouNow makes reasonable efforts to respect the privacy rights
of all of its users. For example, we have taken important steps for
compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) for
EU users and with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users
residing in California.

**PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT**

Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to optimize and
enhance your YouNow experience. We use social sign-in to collect certain
personal data from the social media platforms you use in order to
register you on YouNow. We also collect user generated content such as
your broadcasts, chats, posts or other contributions. Please do not
share highly sensitive personal data using our Services. Some
information about your use of our Services is collected automatically,
such as when you went live and how many fans you have.

As used in this Privacy Policy, **\"Personal Data\"** is as defined in
the GDPR as any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person **(\"data subject\")**. There are a number of different
collections of personal data from you:

**DIRECT COLLECTION:**

**Registration:** When you register to use our Services, we receive
certain information about you through Facebook®, Twitter®, Google+®, or
Instagram®, as applicable to your method of registration. This
information may include your name, your location and language, a profile
picture, your email and mailing address, your phone number and social
following. The registration process is optional for YouNow users who
only wish to view content, but is required for users who would like to
broadcast via YouNow or to use the Services\' more advance options. You
can update your profile data at any time.

**YouNow Activity:** Any user-generated content is collected by YouNow,
such as when you enter profile data, create broadcasts, chats, posts,
moments, when you gift or fan another user or subscribe to a partner\'s
broadcasts. Communication from You: When you contact us with questions,
concerns or for purposes of customer/technical support, we collect the
information contained in your message, which may include your name,
contact details and any other personal data you provide.

**Crypto-Wallet Information:** If you choose to connect a digital
wallet, such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, or Mobile Wallet, with your
YouNow account in order to receive and hold YouNow\'s \"Props\" tokens,
we receive information about that wallet, including the wallet\'s
address, any signature you provide, and the balance in the wallet.

**Survey Information:** We may collect your user information through
surveys we conduct from time to time with respect to our Service.
Participation in and providing information through such surveys is
optional.

**AUTOMATIC COLLECTION:**

**Social Network Data:** Your social following, that is, data about your
connections, will also be collected by YouNow, and if these connections
are YouNow users, they will automatically appear as your fans. Keep in
mind that we receive information from other users\' registrations for
our Services, which may include your social username.

**Metadata:** Information collected behind the scenes by YouNow\'s
servers about your use of YouNow\'s Services. This includes, but is not
limited to, when you last logged in, when you created a broadcast, liked
or commented on someone else\'s broadcast, when you created a moment,
how many bars or coins you have, your total airtime, your IP address and
information about your device or browser.

Automated data collection does not lead to profiling that significantly
affects YouNow users, but simply gives YouNow a clear picture of its
users and influencers. For a complete listing of data fields collected
and used by YouNow, you may contact us
at [privacy\@younow.com](mailto:privacy@younow.com)

**DO NOT PROVIDE SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA:** We ask that you
not send us, and you do not disclose, through a broadcast or other
interaction, \"special categories of personal data\" as defined in the
GDPR (information related to racial or ethnic origin, political
opinions, religious or physiological beliefs, health, biometrics or
genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership
or data concerning data subject\'s sex life or sexual orientation).

For YouNow users who are EU residents, should you provide \"special
categories of personal data\" using our Services, you understand that
you have expressly consented to the collection, use and disclosure of
such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**WHAT\'S PUBLIC AND WHAT\'S NOT?**

Information you voluntarily transmit via our Services is publicly
accessible and may be viewed and used by others without any
restrictions. We do not control such uses of your personally
identifiable information when you share with third parties using our
Services. By using our Services, you assume the risk and acknowledge
that the personal data provided by you may be viewed and used by third
parties and by us for any number of purposes.

Your user profile and most of the content you create when using our
Services, such as your broadcasts, moments, chats, posts, as well as
your fanning and gifting activity is publicly displayed to other YouNow
users. Through your Privacy Settings, you can choose to hide your
location and the number of fans you have. Most of the data that YouNow
collects about your YouNow activity (\"metadata\") is not publicly
available. The number of Props tokens you hold is also not made publicly
available, but other users may be able to see that you hold some Props.

When you stream live video content or interact with the video streams in
real time, this data is available to other YouNow users in real time.
Some metadata, such as number of likes or views, may also be published,
however, most of the metadata that YouNow collects is not publicly
available.

**HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA**

YouNow uses personal data responsibly in order to ensure we are meeting
your expectations of our Services, responding to you when you contact us
and providing a safe space for YouNow users.

We may use the personal data provided to us to:

-   Contact you from time to time with information about service
    > updates, feature updates, newsletters or unique offers, or
    > regarding technical issues or other information important for our
    > Services, or to provide you with the support you are requesting,
    > for example, if clarification is needed when you report another
    > YouNow user;

-   Receive feedback from you and inquire about any features you would
    > like to see in future products. We may also message you through
    > the App to promote new products or services that you may be
    > interested in;

-   Customize, measure and improve our Services and content;

-   Analyze our user database to review preferences and trends for our
    > own internal statistical and analytical purposes, which we may use
    > for marketing purposes and with respect to operations and
    > development;

-   Confirm the accuracy of our data with the data held by third
    > parties;

-   Prevent activity we determine to be potentially illegal, harmful or
    > not in the public interest; and

-   Enforce this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms of Use.

**DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA**

Although YouNow makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need
to disclose personal data as detailed below. These are also the
categories of third parties with whom we have disclosed personal data in
the preceding 12 months:

We may need to disclose your personal data in response to a subpoena,
regulatory investigation or court order, to law enforcement authorities
or regulators who have demonstrated their lawful authority. We may also
disclose personal data for the public interest or in good faith to
prevent harm to individuals. Keep in mind we also share personal data
with trusted third parties in order to effectively provide our Services
to users.

In addition to responding to law enforcement or regulator requests for
personal data, YouNow will disclose personal data to report suspected
illegal activity. For example, media files may be shared with the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

We may also disclose personal data to enforce our policies or respond to
claims that a broadcast or other content violates the right of others.
In all cases, such information will be disclosed in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations.

YouNow may also share your personal data: • With third parties
performing services on our behalf that have agreed to keep such
information confidential (for example, secure payment processing). • In
connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing,
acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale,
transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business
or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership,
personal data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another
company acquires our company, business, or assets, YouNow users will be
notified before any such business transaction occurs, and be given the
opportunity to deactivate or terminate their account should they so
choose to. The acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations
regarding your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.

**SECURING PERSONAL DATA**

YouNow has implemented critical physical, organizational and technical
measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the
data we collect. We have also taken steps to avoid accidental loss or
destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is
completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Services
reduce the likelihood of a data security breach.

In addition, we recommend that you do your part in protecting yourself
from unauthorized access to your account by ensuring no one else uses
your computer or mobile device when you are logged in, by logging off
from our Services when not in use and by keeping your passwords
confidential.

Here are some examples of the data security controls in place at YouNow
(this is not an exhaustive list):

-   The use of encryption when personal data is transferred to YouNow\'s
    > servers;

-   Limited access to personal data by YouNow staff on a need-to-know
    > basis, and the use of robust authentication processes (e.g.
    > complex passwords or two-factor authentication);

-   The use of data centers with effective physical and logical data
    > security controls, and the use of reputable third parties who have
    > demonstrated security consciousness; and

-   Secure office premises and staff that are keenly aware of their data
    > protection responsibilities.

**COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS**

A cookie will be used here to mean a Web cookie, being a small text file
stored on your computer hard drive, or a token or \"mobile cookie\"
placed in the YouNow app\'s local storage, in order to tailor the
environment based on the user\'s preferences and track the user\'s
behavior.

Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse
to accept cookies entirely. You should be aware that if you elect not to
accept cookies, some parts of our Services may not function properly or
permit access.

YouNow uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out
below.

**Essential Cookies:** These cookies are essential to provide you with
our Services. For example, they allow you to log in to our Website or
App and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. We only
use these cookies to provide you with those services.

**Functionality Cookies:** These cookies allow our Website and/or App to
remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering
your language preferences, remembering your login details and
remembering the changes you make to parts of our platform that you can
customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more
personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences
every time you visit us.

**Analytics and Performance Cookies:** These cookies are used to collect
information about traffic to our Services and how our Services are being
used. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.
The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of
visitors, the websites that referred them and the YouNow pages visited,
what time of day they visited, etc. We use this information to help
improve our Services, to gather broad demographic information and to
monitor the level of activity on the YouNow Website and App. We use
Google Analytics and other third party analytics services for this
purpose to capture page and screen views. You can prevent the use of
Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and
installing the browser plugin available via this
link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

**Social Media Cookies:** These cookies are used when you share
information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on
our App and/or Website or you link your account or engage with our
content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook,
Twitter, or Google+. The social network will record that you have done
this.

**NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN**

This Service is a general audience Service, which is neither designed
nor intended to collect personal data from children who are under the
age of thirteen (13). You may reside in a country where local laws fix
the digital age of consent to be older than 13. You may only use YouNow
if you have reached this age of consent, in accordance with applicable
local laws. If you do not meet the digital age of consent of your
country, you must immediately cease using our Services.

In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the U.S.
Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act and other data protection laws
around the world aimed at protecting children, in accordance with our
Terms of Use, **children under the age of thirteen (13) are not
permitted to access or use our Services**, and children under the age of
thirteen (13) should not provide any personal data to the Website or the
App. We ask that parents supervise their children while online and/or
using mobile devices. There are a number of commercially available
parental controls that can be installed on browsers.

**ACCURACY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED**

YouNow wants to keep the personal data we store about you as accurate
and complete as possible. We rely on the user to provide accurate
information and we also have protocols in place to promote data
integrity.

The information that we collect from you is the same information that
you have previously provided to Facebook®, Google+®, Twitter®,
Instagram®, or relevant portions thereof. By updating the information in
one of these social media accounts, you may be automatically updating
the information in your YouNow account the next time that you log in.
You can access and modify your YouNow account information directly by
logging into YouNow and clicking the \'Gear Icon\', as well as make any
changes to any express consents that you may have given with respect to
us contacting you for YouNow news or promotions.

**RETENTION AND STORAGE OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We will retain your information as long as you are an active YouNow
user, to permit us to use it for the purposes that we have communicated
in this Privacy Policy. YouNow has implemented retention schedules to
avoid indefinitely storing personal data that has been collected
indirectly (for example, about a YouNow user\'s social connections).

Personal data this is no longer required for administrative or business
purposes, and that does not need to be archived by YouNow, will be
overwritten or scrambled such that it no longer identifies a YouNow
user. Keep in mind however that third parties who store data on our
behalf have their own retention rules.

**LINKS**

We may offer links from our Services to the sites or apps of our service
providers, affiliates or unrelated companies that may be of interest to
you. YouNow makes no representations as to such third parties\'
practices for dealing with your personal data.

YouNow is not responsible for how other organizations or social media
platforms use and share your personal data. We recommend that you check
the privacy policies of any apps, sites or platforms you associate with
before sharing your personal data with such third parties.

**API SERVICES**

YouNow uses YouTube API services. For more information, please refer to Google’s privacy policy (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).

consenting to the practices relating to personal data collection and use
that are described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that our Services are controlled and offered by YouNow from
its facilities in the United States of America. The laws of other
countries may differ regarding how personally identifiable information

Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those
who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their
own volition, and consent to YouNow\'s collection, storage and use of
their personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy
Policy.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to better
reflect our current data handling practices. Thus, we encourage you to
review this Privacy Policy frequently! The \"Last Updated\" date above
indicates when this Policy was last changed.

Any material change to this Privacy Policy will be clearly displayed on
our Website and App. Personal data collected by us will be dealt with in
accordance with the provisions of our Privacy Policy which were in
effect at the time of collection. If at any time in the future we plan
to share personal data with more third parties, we will maintain GDPR
compliance and a high standard of care for your personal data. Your
continued use of our Services following the posting of any changes to
this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes. Should you not agree,
you should no longer use our Services and go to your Privacy Settings to
terminate your account.
