4. #####Can any YouNow broadcaster receive the four bar-based gifts?
 * There are four gifts that users can buy with bars: 
 * All YouNow broadcasters can receive the 50-Likes, Fan Mail and the Marriage Proposal. However, only Partners receive bars from the blue tip jar. Additionally, only Partners earn revenue when receiving these four bar-based gifts. 

5. #####How much do I earn from the gifts?
 * At the end of your broadcast, a screen will pop up outlining your estimated earnings. Your total earnings will depend on the number of gifts you’ve received throughout your broadcast. Therefore, the more you engage with your viewers, the more you earn. 
 
6. #####What is Fan Mail and how does it work?
 * Viewers can send you Fan Mail during your broadcast. It is an opportunity for them to send you a personalized note that is displayed across the live chat for everyone to see. This is a chance for your fans to really get your attention. As a broadcaster, you have to “accept” the Fan Mail when you receive it in order for it to be displayed during the broadcast. You only earn from this gift when you accept it. It is highly recommended that you acknowledge Fan Mail aloud during your broadcast, as this will encourage further engagement from your fans.

7. #####What determines my five Top Fans?
 * During every broadcast, there is a list of your Top Fans. These are viewers who’ve given you the highest amount of bar-based gifts during athat specific broadcast. Next to these names, there is an indication of how many bars you’ve received from themthey’ve given you during the specific broadcast.  

8. #####Where can I find my Top Fans?
 * During a broadcast,  the Top Fans are displayed right above the chat; they rotate accordingly, depending on the total amount of bars fans have spent.
 * When your top fans are interacting in the chat, their names will pop up with a small crown icon; this way, you can easily recognize your biggest supporters during the broadcast.

9. #####How do I see my overall Top Fans — not just for a specific broadcast?
 * To find the list of your overall Top Fans, go to your profile page, and you’ll see the full list on the bottom right-hand side; these fans also have a crown image next to their name.  [*here*](http://blog.younow.com/post/117267922019/what-does-the-crown-symbol-mean) for more information.

10. #####How can I trend?
 * Broadcasters trend more easily when you broadcastthey are undersing a trending hashtag for their broadcast (for example, #musicians). Choose a topic that best categorizes your content. This will help viewers who have the same interests as you find your broadcast.
 * Trending broadcastsBroadcasters and hashtags on YouNow trend by and hashtags are determined by a combination of factors. This includes , but is not limited to:
    
   a. Total broadcast “likes”

    c. Broadcast activity (e.g., chat, gifts received, etc.)
    
    d. Viewers
    
    e. Broadcast length

11. #####How do I receive more bar-based gifts and “likes” from my viewers during a broadcast?
 * We don’t recommend explicitly asking your viewers for “likes” and bar-based gifts, but here are some tips to encourage gifting and liking:  
  
   a. In order to receive more “likes,” offer an incentive, for example: “When we get to 1,000 ‘likes,’ I’ll tell you a story!”
  
    b. Any time you receive a bar-based gift, thank your fans and/or give them a shout-out. Ultimately, your viewers are looking for your attention, so the more you acknowledge them, the more they’ll want to give.   

12. #####What hashtag should I use when I broadcast?

23. #####How can I receive a summary of my earnings?
 * At the beginning of every month, you will receive an email summary of your earnings from the previous month.

25. #####I’ve been paid, but I still have an outstanding balance on my “earnings” page. Why?
 * If you’ve been paid for your previous month’s earnings, the money displayed on your “earnings” page is most likely your revenue from the current month.  
 * Here’s an example: We paid you February 6th for your January earnings, but you still have $100 displayed on your “earnings” page. That’s because you likely broadcasted at the beginning of February and  you earned $100 from February 1st through February 6th.
