## Understanding risk

Complete protection from harmful content is never a guarantee. There are, however, best practices for using the Internet safely. As parents, you should be aware of the following and be prepared to take countermeasures.

**The risks of inappropriate content**

Viewing inappropriate content can cause anxiety in children and negatively impact their development. This can include pornographic material, violence, propaganda, racism, and encouragement of self-destructive behavior. If you see such content on YouNow, please report it immediately by using our flagging system (see [“Trust & Safety”](/policy/en/trust)).

**Protecting against risk**

Children should learn to recognize inappropriate users and block and report them. They should also be careful not to disclose personal information, such as their address or phone number, on any of their social accounts. Here are some steps parents can take to minimize their child’s risk:

 - Use protection settings, such as time limitations, or only allow social media usage with parental guidance.
 - Outline clear rules for your children. Pay attention to their development. As they get older, they should generally be given more freedom. 
 - Communication will also become more important as children get older. Explain that you are not trying to control them but want to agree upon a set of ground rules.
 - Try to stay up-to-date on Internet trends and best practices. 
 - Talk to your children about the risks of disclosing personal data. 

## What is YouNow?

YouNow is a service that allows users to broadcast themselves and chat with others live. To use YouNow, you need a Wi-Fi-enabled computer with a webcam or a smartphone installed with the YouNow app. Although you need to register with YouNow to broadcast yourself, you can view live broadcasts without logging in. As a registered user, you can “fan” users and communicate with them in chat.

## What parents should be aware of on YouNow

YouNow has developed a comprehensive set of rules to minimize risk. Users under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the platform, and nudity is strictly prohibited. Vulgar and offensive language is also discouraged. 

Parents of minors under the age of 13 should ensure their children are not using YouNow by blocking it from family computers and/or smartphones, and using youth-protection software. With children 13+, discuss YouNow's rules and insist on compliance. You should also make sure they're aware of YouNow’s flagging, blocking, and reporting systems (see below). It is particularly important that you let them know that you are open to discussing issues relating to their online lives. 

## The most important YouNow rules

 - No violence and/or self-harm
 - Absolutely no nudity or sexually explicit behavior
 - No bullying, harassment, or hate speech
 - No onscreen illicit substance use
 - No underage (under 13) users
 - No posting of private contact information
 - No prank calls to emergency authorities or hotlines
 - No solicitation or encouragement of rule-breaking
 - No chat spam
 - No impersonating other members
 - No copyright infringement

You can find a detailed description of YouNow’s rules [here](www.http://www.younow.com/policy/en/rules).

## Flagging, blocking, and reporting

If you see a user breaking YouNow’s rules, you may take the following measures:

**Blocking a User**

On YouNow, users can block any other user from contacting them in broadcasts and on their YouNow profile pages. Simply click on the  offending the user's name and use the drop-down menu under “Report” to find the option to "block." On the app, you’ll find the “Report” button by tapping the user’s name.

**Flagging a User**

Do your part! All users should flag any content that violates YouNow's policies or puts any member of the community at risk.

When you flag a user, the flag goes to live moderators who will review the situation and take action as they see fit. Please only flag content that you deem to be inappropriate! 

## What minors should be aware of on YouNow

Children under 13 do not have the necessary maturity to handle sensitive online interactions and should not use YouNow. Older minors should ensure that they:

 - Know the rules of YouNow and act accordingly. 
 - Are using a nickname and not their full name.
 - Never disclose personal information.
 - Do not undress in any fashion.
 - Do not engage in direct communication or in-person contact with people they meet online.
 - Solicit the consent of third parties before filming them. 
 - Know how to flag users and contact the moderator.
