1.1.        Welcome to the Service. It was created by YouNow as a platform for personal communication and entertainment.

1.2.        As You probably know by now, the Service is a live-video social entertainment platform. Subject to the Terms of Use (as they might be amended) and any other applicable agreements between You and YouNow, the Service allows You to broadcast Your video (via web or mobile device) for viewing - IN REAL TIME - by a public online audience including followers and fans and to view the video broadcasts of other users of the Service. The Service offers other functions as well that are described in the Terms of Use and in notices and publications from YouNow. YouNow reserves the right in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete features and functions of the Service at any time.

1.3.        We take responsibility for what we have created, and You agree to take responsibility for Your use of our Service whether as a creator of Content (defined below) or as a viewer. While You have fun using the Service, we require that You treat others with respect, do not use the Service for anything that would be deemed illegal or obscene and always observe the Golden Rule (&quot;do unto others...&quot;).

You shall not remove or alter any copyright notice, Trademark or other proprietary or restrictive notice or legend affixed to any material provided as part of the Service or otherwise provided by YouNow.

You expressly release YouNow from any and all liability both known and unknown arising from Your use of any third party service.

**4.        USER GENERATED CONTENT**

4.1.        The term &quot; **Content**&quot; refers to any information, data, communication, video, text, graphics, photos (including but not limited to &quot;Archives&quot; and &quot;Moments&quot;), sounds, music, audiovisual works, chat feed comments, gifting and/or other contributions appearing on the Service that users of the Service may broadcast, upload, or otherwise submit (collectively, &quot; **Submit**&quot;) to the Service, or view or access on the Service.

4.2.        All right, title and interest in Content Submitted by You to the Service, to the extent it does not belong to third parties or Guests (see Section 5), will remain with You, subject to the licenses You make hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, You hereby waive any moral rights that You may have in Your Content in favor of YouNow and anyone acting with the authorization of YouNow.

4.3.        YouNow assumes no responsibility for Content Submitted by You or any other users of the Service. You shall be solely liable for Content that You Submit to the Service, including without limitation for any consequences of publishing the Content through the Service. Your potential liability applies, for example, to any Content that You include in a broadcast initiated by You, even if you are not the creator of that Content.

4.4.        You hereby affirm, represent and warrant that You will own or obtain all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to enable YouNow to publish and otherwise utilize as authorized in the Terms of Use, the Content You Submit to the Service.

All of the provisions in this Section 4 shall apply with equal force if You Submit Content that includes advertorials, native advertising, or sponsorship (&quot; **Sponsored Content**&quot;). Without limitation, all of Your representations, warranties, indemnification obligations, and other obligations under the Terms of Use will apply equally to Sponsored Content as they would to any other Content You Submit.

4.8.        In addition to all other termination provisions set forth in the Terms of Use, YouNow reserves the right to terminate immediately Your access to the Service if You fail to make disclosures in any Sponsored Content You Submit in accordance with the FTC Guidelines or as otherwise required by applicable law. Further, in the event that Sponsored Content Submitted by You includes material or promotes products or services which, in YouNow&#39;s sole opinion, might insult or offend users of the Service or which might tend to injure the success of the Service or the good name of YouNow, or if Your Sponsored Content does not comply with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in Section 6 below, or, as determined in YouNow&#39;s sole opinion, conflicts with or does not align with YouNow&#39;s business, community, ethical or other goals, then YouNow shall have the right (a) to require that You cease submission of the Sponsored Content and/or (b) immediately terminate Your access to the Service.

4.9.        By Submitting Content to the Service, You are granting YouNow and its agents and designees a **perpetual** worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform such Content in connection with the Service and with the businesses of YouNow and those of its successors, licensees, and affiliates, including without limitation for the purpose of promoting and advertising the Service and redistributing part or all of the Service (and works derived therefrom) in any and all media formats and through any and all media channels now known or later developed.

4.10.        Without limitation, the foregoing license includes the right of YouNow to grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access Your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service, subject to the Terms of Use. Such functionality currently includes the ability of users to capture segments from broadcasts of Content and to make such segments available on users&#39; own YouNow Account at the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such segments via any and all channels of social media. (YouNow shall have the right but not the obligation to remove such segments from users&#39; account pages at the Service.)

In connection with the exercise of each of the foregoing rights licensed by You, You consent to use of Your name, image, likeness, photograph, performance, voice, biographical details, Facebook ID, Twitter handle, Google+ ID, Instagram ID, profile pictures, and any other attributes of Your persona in any and all media now known or hereafter developed, including but not limited to the Internet (such as on the Site and on third party social media websites) and mobile applications, worldwide, in perpetuity; all without payment, compensation or further notification to or permission from You, except where prohibited by law.

You hereby release and discharge all claims both known and unknown against, and covenant not to sue, YouNow and Related Parties (defined below) with respect to the use of any Content Submitted by You as authorized by the Terms of Use (including without limitation any claims that such use violates any proprietary right such as copyrights or rights of publicity/privacy).

**5.        GUEST BROADCASTS**

5.1.        While using the Service, You may either initiate (as a broadcaster) or participate as a Guest (defined below) in a broadcast through a Guest Broadcast or by Submitting comments or images, by gifting, Submitting chat, or by using another feature of the Service that introduces Content onto the screen (&quot; **Guest Broadcasting**&quot;). For purposes of the Terms of Use, the initiating broadcaster shall be deemed the &quot; **Host**&quot; of the Guest Broadcast (and shall control the Guest Broadcast) and a user contributing to the Guest Broadcast shall be deemed a &quot; **Guest**.&quot; For clarity, only users of the Service who have agreed to be bound by the Terms of Use shall be eligible to participate as Guests in Guest Broadcasts.

5.2.        Any content Submitted by a Guest to a Guest Broadcast shall be considered Content for all purposes of the Terms of Use. Without limitation, in connection with such Content and otherwise, the Guest shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use, including without limitation the Acceptable Use Policy in Section 6 below and the provisions of Section 13, provided that the Guest shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Host to the same extent provided in Section 14 with respect to YouNow and Related Parties (as defined below) from and against any and all Damages (defined below) arising out of any Content Submitted by a Guest in connection with a Guest Broadcast.

5.3.        For clarity, all right, title and interest in Content Submitted by a Guest to a Guest Broadcast, to the extent it does not belong to third parties, will remain with the Guest, subject to the following: In addition to all licenses relating to Content provided above to YouNow and others, each Guest hereby grants to the Host, and each Host hereby grants to each Guest, a **perpetual** worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such Guest Broadcast, including Content Submitted by the Guest or the Host. This would include, by way of example, posting on the Host&#39;s or Guest&#39;s (as applicable) YouNow account page or to social media, to the extent the functionality of the Service permits.

Each Guest and each Host hereby releases and discharges all claims both known and unknown against, and covenants not to sue (a) YouNow and Related Parties; and (b) the Host (if a Guest) and each Guest (if a Host); with respect to any use of any Guest Broadcast as authorized by the Terms of Use (including without limitation any claims that any such use violates any proprietary right of the Host or Guest as applicable, such as copyrights or rights of publicity/privacy).

**6.        ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY**

6.1.        You expressly agree that all Content, including without limitation Sponsored Content, that You Submit will not be: (1) defamatory, libelous, abusive, or obscene, and without limitation, shall not include material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, federal, or international law; (2) infringe on the copyright or any other proprietary right of any person or entity; (3) invade the privacy of any person; (4) contain a virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, or any other harmful program or component; or (5) be otherwise inappropriate or unlawful.

6.2.        You also agree that You will not (i) use the Service to spam others or create mass-emails, (ii) continue harmful behavior if You have been warned of such; (iii) use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, &quot;robots,&quot; &quot;spiders,&quot; or &quot;offline readers,&quot; that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouNow servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser, and/or (iv) create a false identity (except for a user name unique to you that does not violate the rights of a third party, such as a celebrity or owner of intellectual property); and/or (v) forge an email address or header; or in any other way attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of the message. You agree not to copy, scrape, re-post, take screen shots of, save, share, distribute, modify or make derivative works of any Content provided through the Service, except as expressly provided through the Service&#39;s functionality and in the Terms of Use.

6.3.        You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes.

6.4.        YouNow uses YouTube API services. By connecting a YouTube account, users agree to be bound by YouTube's Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).

**7.        VIRTUAL CURRENCY/IN-SERVICE PURCHASES/PURCHASE TERMS**

7.1.        At times, the Service will permit You to &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;purchase&quot;, or &quot;earn&quot; for use in the Service: (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual bars (&quot; **Bars**&quot;); or (b) virtual in-service items, including but not limited to fan mail, visual gifts, thumbs up, tipping (together with virtual currency, &quot; **Virtual Items**&quot;). These real world terms, however, are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact &quot;own&quot; the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, YouNow grants You a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that include the use of these Virtual Items.

7.2.        A purchase of Virtual Items is complete only when you receive confirmation through the Service that You have redeemed iTunes or Google Play Store Wallet credits, or other third party currency accepted by the Service. Any virtual currency balance shown in Your YouNow Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license to use the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to Your YouNow Account, nor will You be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if Your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated.

7.3.        Your gift of certain Virtual Items to a broadcaster on the Service may, but will not necessarily, appear on screen or in the chat feed of the Content You are viewing. Purchase of the &quot;Chat Now&quot; privilege during high-traffic broadcasts will give You the opportunity to rejoin a chat feed that has become over-full and to remain in the chat feed for the remainder of the broadcast. Purchasers of &quot;Chat Now&quot; will receive priority over users who are participating in the chat feed for free.

7.4.        Bars and other Virtual Items gifted to broadcasters may result in some revenue to them as determined in YouNow&#39;s sole discretion; however, YouNow makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the Bars or Virtual Items You may give a broadcaster will correlate to the revenue such broadcaster may receive from YouNow. All in-app purchases are subject to a 30% fee charged by Google or Apple, depending on the platform. After the platforms remove their fees, Partners get 60% of the remaining revenue, and YouNow takes 40% of the remaining revenue.

7.5.        Only users of the Service who initiate a broadcast or a Guest session will be eligible for Bars and other Virtual Items.


7.6  All purchases of Products you place through YouNow or its vendors are non-refundable, except to the extent we decide otherwise, in our sole and absolute discretion. All prices we show on this Service are subject to change without notice.

7.7 All subscription purchases will automatically renew for successive periods equal in duration to the initial subscription term, unless either party notifies the other party in writing before the expiration of the then-current subscription term that such party does not wish to renew the subscription for an additional subscription term. You have the right to cancel the subscription renewal yourself.

7.8 If you dispute any of your charges at any time, YouNow has the right to contest the dispute and you acknowledge that YouNow may furnish all details of the transaction to the governing body. If you cancel your account at any time, you will not receive any refund.

7.9 You expressly agree that you will not reverse or attempt to reverse any transaction(s) to add funds to your account that you complete. You also agree that we may deduct any amounts associated with your account if a transaction is subsequently reversed via a chargeback, reversal, claim, or is otherwise deemed fraudulent or erroneous. We may also deduct any amounts held by you in your account to satisfy any outstanding amount owed by you to us under these Terms or otherwise. We reserve the right to report, suspend, and/or terminate accounts and these Terms for chargeback abuse.

7.10 When you purchase YouNow products, your purchases are non-refundable and are made at your own risk. You engage in transactions between you and other users at your own risk.

7.11 YouNow is under no obligation to provide any refund (either in cash or in credits) for any item made by a third party content creator that is broken, that later becomes disabled, that is later removed or altered by the content creator or by YouNow, or that was inappropriately submitted. If you have any billing problems or questions, please visit the YOuNow Help Center [Link to FAQ]. Additionally, if an item is removed from this Service as a result of an intellectual property infringement claim (or Unsuitable for YouNow content) and/or YouNow disables your use of such an item as set forth in these Terms, any cash and/or any credits that you used to purchase such items will not be refunded.

7.12 We may revise or modify Products, Product information, or pricing without notice. We are not responsible for typos or errors in product descriptions or prices.

**8.        PROPS**

8.1.        Access. In order to receive any benefits on the Service from holding cryptographic tokens issued by YouNow (&quot; **Props**&quot;), You must (a) complete the Approval Process described in 8.4 below, (b) link a digital wallet (such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, or Mobile Wallet) (a &quot; **Wallet**&quot;) to Your YouNow Account by following the instructions we provide to You in the Service and (c) associate a certain Props balance (such balance may change from time to time) with the Wallet that you linked to Your YouNow Account. Props may be associated with the Wallet that you linked to Your YouNow Account either (i) upon receiving Props into that Wallet from an external source such that the Props were transferred to your Wallet by third parties or (ii) upon earning Props by taking certain actions as described below under &quot;Earning Props&quot; such that we send Props to the Wallet you associated with your YouNow Account. If You connect a Wallet with Your YouNow Account, You provide YouNow with the public address of your Wallet and authorize us to use that public address in connection with our provision of the Service, including to read the balance of Props therein, display the balance of Props in such Wallet to You through the Service or display to other users of the Service that You hold Props, and to send all Props you earn in connection with the Service to that Wallet. YouNow will send Props you may receive as rewards under these Terms only to this Wallet. You acknowledge that any balance of Props displayed does not refer to any credit balance of real currency, virtual currency, or its equivalent. By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You represent and warrant that You are the exclusive owner and controller of such Wallet and the contents of the Wallet, including all Props associated with that Wallet and all Props that we send to that Wallet, and have all necessary permissions to authorize us to access such Wallet as contemplated by us, the Service, and these Terms. You cannot sell, purchase, exchange, or grant Props through the Service. Further, by agreeing to the Terms, You agree to not transfer Your YouNow account to anyone else.

8.2.        Rewarding Activities. We may reward certain activities that You may perform in the App, which may include without limitation: (1) Broadcasting or Guesting &quot;Liked&quot; content, which generally includes initiating a live stream or guesting within another user&#39;s live stream in the Service, for which You receive &quot;likes&quot; from audience members, (2) purchasing Bars, which You may purchase in the Service, (3) actively watching, which generally includes using the product on a screen in which video content is playing live for a certain amount of viewing time, in which the live video is in the foreground and the audio is not set to mute (&quot;Active Watching&quot;). The specific amount of any rewards to You after performing any of these activities will be determined in YouNow&#39;s sole discretion. In addition, YouNow may in its sole discretion adjust the circumstances and types of activities that are rewarded in the app. The specific amount of rewards is determined by a formula that the Company may modify at any time in its sole discretion. You understand and agree that the amount of any rewards depends, in part, on the volume, audience, and nature of Content created by other users on the same calendar period and, thus, the same Content may not have the same rewards on different calendar periods. Further, You agree that You are not entitled to earn or receive any rewards of any kind in connection with Your activity on the Service or Your Content or use of the Service in any of the following circumstances: (a) you are not at least 18 years of age or older (b) if one or more third parties claim rights to certain elements of Your Content except in cases where the Company&#39;s policies or systems support sharing a portion of the revenues with You, as determined by the Company; (c) if the ability to receive rewards is disabled on Your Content by either You or the Company; or (d) Your YouNow Account is suspended, banned, erased, or terminated. The Company will use reasonable efforts to notify You if any of these circumstances should occur.

8.3.        Pending Props. If You perform an in-app activity that we determine to reward, the performance of this activity alone does not entitle you to receive Props. If you perform one of these actions, we may indicate that you are provisionally entitled to receive Props by associating &quot;Pending Props&quot; with your YouNow account. Pending Props are not Props or other cryptocurrencies and are only accounting mechanisms used by YouNow to signify who is provisionally entitled to receive Props Tokens because they have completed certain in-app activities. Pending Props are not transferrable, and You may not transfer any Pending Props associated with Your YouNow Account. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that You have violated these Terms, in our sole discretion, we may cause You to forfeit all of the Pending Props associated with Your YouNow Account.

8.4.        Receiving Props. In order to receive Props, You must comply with these Terms. Pending Props may only become Props when (i) you have verified your identity with us through a KYC verification process and gone through an AML check, each as described below, (ii) you have supplied all tax forms requested by us and completed any other documentation requested by us in our sole discretion, (iii) you have linked a Wallet to Your YouNow Account by following the instructions we provide to You, (iv) we have completed all fraud checks or other checks we deem necessary to confirm that rewards are validly issued pursuant to these Terms, and (v) YouNow determines, in its sole discretion, that you are eligible to receive Props (collectively, (i) through (v) are the &quot; **Approval Process**&quot;). In connection with the operation of the App, YouNow collects information from users that YouNow deems necessary to collect in order to complete know-you-client (KYC) verification and anti-money laundering (AML) checks. We may require that you provide all information that we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary in order to allow us to complete these checks. In addition, we may require that you have a minimum number of Pending Props, which number YouNow can adjust from time to time, before you can complete these required KYC and AML verifications. As a result, You must have a minimum level of Pending Props to any Props in connection with Your use of the Service.

8.5.        If You fail to provide all information and documentation requested by us in connection with the Approval Process within 120 days following the date that we associated a Pending Prop with your user account, or if YouNow determines, in its sole discretion, that you are not eligible to receive Props, we may cancel the Pending Props, and you will not be entitled to receive any Props in connection with any such Pending Props.

8.6.        Transfer of Props. If YouNow determines You are eligible to receive Props, we may reward Your activities with Props in an amount equal to the number of Pending Props for which all of the above-described steps have completed. In order to complete a reward of Props, YouNow will initiate a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that will cause the requisite number of Props to be associated with Your Wallet.  In order to minimize costs associated with effecting transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, YouNow may effect these transactions on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent, basis and any issuance to You will occur only in connection with the next-occurring issuance or, if the award cannot be made at the next-occurring issuance in a commercially reasonable manner, then the award will be effected as soon as reasonably practicable. Upon the initiation of this transaction, the corresponding Pending Props will be cancelled in Your Account.

8.7.        Props Functionality / Props Benefits. Props may provide users with premium functionality within the Service.  These functionalities may include, without limitation: (1) Level Status: the more Props a user has, the higher their status level display associated with that user within the service is; and (2) Bar daily stipend: users on YouNow may receive a daily stipend of Bars, and users who have a certain balance of Props, may receive additional daily bars according to a schedule published by YouNow from time to time. These benefits may vary based on the level of Props holdings that a user has. For example, users with more Props will be afforded higher &quot;Level Status&quot; within the app and may receive daily bar stipends in greater amounts. For purposes of making the calculation of how many Props You have, YouNow may count Pending Props together with Props for social-media and in-app related benefits. As a result, for example, in order to determine your &quot;Level Status&quot; in the app, we count both Props and Pending Props.

8.8.        We may in our sole discretion modify these functions for Your Props. For example, we may adjust how &quot;Level Status&quot; is displayed, the varying levels of statuses, what benefits are afforded to these statuses, when Bar stipends are given to users, and the specific amount of Bar stipends afforded to any users. We may add to or remove these basic functionalities for Props in the app in the future. For purposes of added social-media functionalities in the future, we may in our sole discretion determine to count or not count Pending Props together with Props when making the calculation of how many Props You have. Pending Props will not necessarily always entitle You to the same functionality that Props entitle you to in the app.

8.9.        Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if You violate these Terms, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to remove you from the Service and deny You the benefits of these functions in their entirety.  As a result, if you violate these Terms, You may not ever enjoy the benefits we afford to other users who hold Props and have Pending Props associated with their user account. In addition, if YouNow discontinues or ceases providing the Service, or substantially reduces the functionality of the Service, for any reason, then you may not be able to continue enjoying the benefits associated with Props.

8.10.        YouNow may terminate Your eligibility to receive rewards in connection with Your activity or Your Content or the Service for any reason without prior notice to You. If You decide to terminate Your YouNow Account or participation in this rewards program, YouNow may NOT be able to complete any pending rewards to You, and for the avoidance of doubt, You will have no right to receive any rewards and your Pending Props may be cancelled. Additionally, YouNow may suspend or terminate Your YouNow Account, or otherwise terminate Your participation in the rewards program or in connection with the Service, immediately and without notice if YouNow determines or suspects, in its sole discretion, that You have violated the Terms or any other agreement between You and, on the other hand, YouNow or any of its affiliates. Upon termination of Your YouNow Account or Your participation in the rewards program, all other rights and duties of the Parties toward each other shall cease.

8.11.        No Employment. You are engaging YouNow for the use of the Service, including the App, and ability to potentially receive Props. You are not an employee of YouNow or any affiliated entity. In the event that any court or agency determines that you performed services for YouNow or any affiliated entity, you agree that it is the express intention of YouNow and You that Your participation on the App and through the Service is as an independent contractor to YouNow. Nothing in these Terms shall in any way be construed to constitute You acting as an agent, employee or representative of YouNow. You acknowledge and agree that You are obligated to report as income all compensation received in connection with your use of the Service. You agree to and acknowledge the obligation to pay all self-employment and other taxes on such income. You further acknowledge and agree that you are not required to make or share Content nor do you have any schedule or requirements related thereto except as provided herein.

8.12.        No Advice. YouNow is not providing any advice relating to the Props or the advisability of using the Service for the purpose of receiving any Props, and you agree that you have received and have had an opportunity to review the Props Offering Circular and all the information, including risk factors, described therein. You agree that you are using the Service without being furnished any offering literature other than the Props Offering Circular, and that you are making Your decision to participate and use the Service, including for purposes of obtaining Props, solely in reliance upon the information contained in the Props Offering Circular and upon any investigation made by You, but not on any recommendation to participate or use the Service by YouNow or any of its affiliates.

8.13.        Rights. You agree and understand that the receipt of Props (i) does not provide You with rights of any form with respect to the Company or its revenues or assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights, (ii) is not a loan to the Company, (iii) does not create any binding obligation enforceable against the Company with respect to Props following their delivery, and (iv) does not provide You with any ownership or other interest in YouNow or its platform or the Service.

8.14.        Sufficient Knowledge. By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You agree and represent that You have sufficient knowledge, understanding, and experience, in financial and business matters, and of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms, and other material characteristics of cryptographic tokens, token wallets and other token storage mechanisms, public and private key management, blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems, including YouNow&#39;s network and platform, to understand the terms of these Terms and the Props Offering Circular, and such knowledge, understanding, and experience enables You to evaluate the merits and risks of using the Service for purposes of obtaining Props.

8.15.        Participation for Own Account. By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You agree and represent that You are using the Service for and receiving any Props in connection with the Service solely for the Your own account, and not with a view toward or in connection with distribution, subdivision or fractionalization thereof. You agree not to engage in underwriting or other distribution activity. You have no agreement or other arrangement, formal or informal, with any person or entity to sell, transfer or pledge any Props, or which would guarantee You any profit, or insure against any loss with respect to Props, and You have no plans to enter into any such agreement or arrangement.

8.16.        Location.  By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You represent and warrant that You: (a) (1) are not located or domiciled; (2) do not have a place of business; and (3) are not conducting business (any of which would make Participant a &quot; **Resident**&quot;) in a jurisdiction in which access to or use of the Service or Props is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act, (2) a Resident of, or located in, a jurisdiction that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes, or (3) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce&#39;s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury&#39;s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State&#39;s Debarred Parties List. You agree that if Your country of residence or other circumstances change such that the above representations are no longer accurate, You will immediately cease using the Service and Props and YouNow may refuse to deliver Props to You. In addition, you represent and warrant that you are not a Resident of the states of Arizona, Nebraska, North Dakota or Texas.

8.17.        Protections. You understand acknowledge and agree that the distribution of Props contemplated in these Terms and the Props Offering Circular is not fully registered with the Securities Exchange Commission because it is being made in reliance on Regulation A under the Securities Act, which exempts the Company from certain reporting and other requirements related to the Company, Props and their sale, and that the Company is not registered or licensed with any federal or state regulator as an investment adviser, broker-dealer, money services business, money transmitter, or virtual currency business, or under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;Advisers Act&quot;) or the Investment Company Act of 1940 (&quot;1940 Act&quot;). As a result, You will not be afforded the full set of protections provided to the clients and customers of such entities under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), the Advisers Act or the 1940 Act, or any money services business, money transmitter, or virtual currency laws.

8.18.        Compliance with Law. It is the intent of the Company and its affiliates to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws designed to combat money laundering and similar illegal activities. By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You represent, covenant, and agree that, to the best of Your knowledge based on reasonable investigation:

8.18.1.        When requested by the Company, You will provide any and all additional information to the Company, and You understand and agree that the Company or any of its affiliates may release confidential information about You and, if applicable, any underlying beneficial owner or related person to U.S. regulators and law enforcement authorities, deemed by the Company reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning money laundering and similar activities. The Company reserves the right to request any information as is necessary to verify Your identity and the source of any payment to the Company. In the event of delay or failure by You to produce any information required for verification purposes, participation in Service for Props by You may be refused.

Neither You nor any person for whom You are acting as agent or nominee in connection with use of the Service is: (a) a Prohibited Participant (as defined below); (b) senior foreign political figure, (c) any member of a senior foreign political figure&#39;s &quot;immediate family,&quot; which includes the figure&#39;s parents, siblings, spouse, children and in-laws, or any close associate of a senior foreign political figure, (d) or a person or entity resident in, or organized or chartered under, the laws of a non-cooperative jurisdiction; (e) or a person or entity resident in, or organized or chartered under, the laws of a jurisdiction that has been designated by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Section 311 of the Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 as warranting special measures due to money laundering concerns. &quot;Prohibited Participant&quot; shall mean a person or entity whose name appears on (i) the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control; (ii) other lists of prohibited persons and entities as may be mandated by applicable law or regulation; or (iii) such other lists of prohibited persons and entities as may be provided to any Blockstack Party in connection therewith.

8.19.        Tax. You agree that upon the Company&#39;s request, You must provide the Company with appropriate tax forms or other applicable Internal Revenue Service forms and any additional documentation required by the Company as may be requested from time to time by the Company in order to comply with applicable law, in order to continue to receive Props. Further, You agree that, as an independent contractor, You shall be solely responsible for any and all taxes, Social Security contributions or payments, disability insurance, unemployment taxes, and other payroll type taxes applicable to any Props paid to You under these Terms.

8.20.        Use of Props. By linking a Wallet to Your YouNow Account, You agree that you are responsible for using Props in accordance with applicable law, including with respect to making your own determination as to whether any transfer of Props by you is in compliance with state and foreign securities laws, as applicable.

17.6.        The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who is expert in the field of Internet services in New York, N.Y., and administered by the AAA in accordance with its streamlined commercial arbitration rules and procedures or subsequent versions thereof, except to the extent such rules and procedures may be inconsistent with the terms of the Terms of Use. Either party may demand arbitration of a Dispute by giving the other party written notice to such effect, which notice will describe, in reasonable detail, the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the filing party&#39;s request for relief and will include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed. In no event will You be entitled to recover punitive, special or exemplary damages or seek injunctive or any other equitable relief.

17.7.

**18.        MISCELLANEOUS**

18.1.        Nothing in the Terms of Use shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between You and us. You may not assign any of Your rights or delegate any of Your duties under the Terms of Use without the prior written consent of YouNow. YouNow may assign this Agreement and/or any of its rights, and delegate its duties in its discretion. Any purported assignment which is inconsistent with the foregoing shall be null and void. The Terms of Use, its interpretation, performance or any breach thereof, shall be construed in accordance with, and all questions with respect thereto shall be determined by, the laws of the state of New York applicable to contracts entered into and wholly to be performed within said state without regard to conflicts of laws. No waiver of any breach of any provision of the Terms of Use shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. In the event any provision of the Terms of Use shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. In resolving any dispute or construing any provision hereunder, there shall be no presumptions made or inferences drawn (i) because the attorneys for one of the parties drafted the agreement; (ii) because of the drafting history of the agreement; or (iii) because of the inclusion of a provision not contained in a prior draft, or the deletion of a provision contained in a prior draft. All representations, warranties and indemnities contained herein or made by You in connection herewith shall survive any termination, expiration, or suspension of Your rights under the Terms of Use. Section headings are for convenience only and are not a part of the Terms of Use. The Terms of Use contain the entire understanding of the parties and cannot be amended except by a writing signed by both parties. No party hereto has relied on any statement, representation or promise of any other party or with any other officer, agent, employee or attorney for the other party in executing this Agreement except as expressly stated herein.
